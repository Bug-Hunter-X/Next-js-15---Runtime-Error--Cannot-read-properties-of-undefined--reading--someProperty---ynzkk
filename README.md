# Next.js 15 Runtime Error: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'someProperty')

This repository demonstrates a runtime error encountered in Next.js 15 when attempting to access a property of an undefined variable within a functional component.  Prior versions might have handled this differently, perhaps with a silent failure or different error message. 

## Problem

The `about.js` file attempts to access the `someProperty` of `nonExistentVariable`, which is undefined.  This causes a runtime error in Next.js 15.

## Solution

The `aboutSolution.js` file demonstrates how to handle this error using optional chaining or nullish coalescing. This prevents the runtime error by providing a default value in case `nonExistentVariable` is undefined.

## Reproduction

1. Clone this repository.
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Run the development server: `npm run dev`
4. Navigate to `/about` to see the error in the original code or to see the solution in the solution file.
